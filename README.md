Man Management Series (Teachings of Bhagawan Sri Sathya Sai Baba to Managers)

### Episode 153 : 

If you come out as managers, some students sign for an appointment where they receive Rs.3000 to Rs.4000 salary. He meets a senior MBA boy who says that he receives Rs.7000, another says that he receives Rs.9000. So this person thinks that he gets only Rs.3000, not Rs.7000 or Rs.9000 as others. Nowadays people are working for money but not for quality. However, what should our students do? You take Rs.7000 or Rs.10000. First of all examine your conscience, do not examine others. Am I working in accordance to the salary I receive. If I do not, then I should control myself. Am I doing work worth 3000 rupees? When I do not do work worth Rs.3000, how can I aspire for Rs.9000. So this is enough for me even if it is less. But I should not reduce quality. So you should develop you own quality, very soon you will be able to receive Rs.9000. Certainly you will get that much. You should develop such confidence. The most important thing is that you must have faith in God. When there is faith in God, there is no scope for any mistake. Because of mistakes, you will commit a sin. Therefore there should be fear of sin. Why should there be fear of sin? What will the society think? Therefore think of societyâ€”that is morality in society. If you keep morality of society and fear of sin in mind, then there will be love for God. Then you will certainly succeed.  

> All the managers should have 
> love for God
> fear of sin and 
> morality in society. 
 
These three should be kept in mind because we should not commit such a sin and should not deceive others. We should do our duty as per the requirement. We should have strong faith, then all industries in our country will progress.
