Man Management Series (Teachings of Bhagawan Sri Sathya Sai Baba to Managers)

### Episode 153 : 

If you come out as managers, some students sign for an appointment where they receive Rs.3000 to Rs.4000 salary. He meets a senior MBA boy who says that he receives Rs.7000, another says that he receives Rs.9000. So this person thinks that he gets only Rs.3000, not Rs.7000 or Rs.9000 as others. Nowadays people are working for money but not for quality. However, what should our students do? You take Rs.7000 or Rs.10000. First of all examine your conscience, do not examine others. Am I working in accordance to the salary I receive. If I do not, then I should control myself. Am I doing work worth 3000 rupees? When I do not do work worth Rs.3000, how can I aspire for Rs.9000. So this is enough for me even if it is less. But I should not reduce quality. So you should develop you own quality, very soon you will be able to receive Rs.9000. Certainly you will get that much. You should develop such confidence. The most important thing is that you must have faith in God. When there is faith in God, there is no scope for any mistake. Because of mistakes, you will commit a sin. Therefore there should be fear of sin. Why should there be fear of sin? What will the society think? Therefore think of societyâ€”that is morality in society. If you keep morality of society and fear of sin in mind, then there will be love for God. Then you will certainly succeed.  

> All the managers should have 
> love for God
> fear of sin and 
> morality in society. 
 
These three should be kept in mind because we should not commit such a sin and should not deceive others. We should do our duty as per the requirement. We should have strong faith, then all industries in our country will progress.

### Episode 154 :

Re-engineering - Suppose a factory is financially weak, they will be prepared to go for all kinds of loans in a desperate manner. Then buy that industry at a cheap price. Why has it become cheap and why has this decline come? Is it because the industry has no money or is it because of mismanagement or merely innocence? You study well! The study is re-engineering. Re-engineering is to study where the mistake lies. Totalling or calculating is not re-engineering. For what reason has it come to this stage? You should study this very well and then you should solve this problem. Only then progress will be made. When it grows, then bring back the person whom you had bought it, explain everything to him. You can also make him a partner. Then only you will get the value of re-engineering. Because he sold it at a cheap price, do not buy it. Because of his innocence, it has come to this state. So explain to him that because of his innocence, it has happened like that and tell him to take care in the future. Make him a partner or a director or a shareholder. If you do that, factories will never close down in India.  

Ceiling On Desires -  What our students should do is to make sure that the factories will never be closed down in a hasty manner. Our life today depends on industries and right from dawn to dusk we use various items manufactured in industries. In the morning we require toothpaste, a toothbrush, soap, comb, mirror, etc. Where from do you get all these things? You buy them from the market. But from where does the market receive these? We should develop even the small things. When we do that, our country will become Annapoorna and there will be no shortage of anything. But now what happens is that money is with the rich only and the poor are becoming poorer. The middle class people are staying in the same position. We should have equality in society, though the same in absolute terms is impossible. The reason being that there is no balance in money.
